# Would you look who it is...!
Hey there! I figured it would be odd to revive this blog with no mention of the gap, so here I am. I initially made this blog during a school semester when I had a bit of time to poke at some side projects I found interesting. Since then, I had lacked the same time (thanks, degree requirements!). However, now that I have graduated, I have a little more consistent time. This had me thinking I will have more potential time to pursue some neat stuff to put here.

### But that had me thinking...
Why stop at malware or HTB posts? It may be time to leverage the full ability of the category system afforded by jekyll and really turn this into something I can express myself with. More reverse engineering challenges, some words on other hobbies I partake in, or perhaps even pieces with my cooking. Who knows. 

### All said,
I'll be taking some surefire time every Wednesday to try and get something insightful out onto this blog. Partially for career search reasons, partially for self satisfaction. Let's see if we can make this place a neat look into my life, hm?
