Hey there! I'm Jake. I'm a cybersecurity student who's here to learn as much as he can about the systems aroung him, and hopefully mess with a few on the way there.
Some fun facts:

* I'm a Cybersecurity student at Rochester Institute of Technology.
	* I initially came here for Computational Mathematics, but if I'm being honest, I've always belonged here.
* I'm from New Jersey, only I'm allowed to talk bad about it.
* Linux is my home! My network runs it, I always have a terminal open to my ubuntu server box, and I bring it everywhere I go.
	* Vim for life.
* I discovered Cybersecurity as a field of interest out of an interest in assembly programming. A need to always find a deeper language or technology to work with had evolved into an interest in learning more about all machines.
* C is my favorite language! C++ is okay too ;)
	* Lets be honest though python is just so much quicker, so I use that too.
* I've played a lot of competitive video games! Competition is a strong outlet for me.
	* I could beat many of you in Super Smash Brothers: Melee ;)
