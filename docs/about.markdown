Hey there! I'm Jake. I'm a cybersecurity student who's here to learn as much as he can about the systems aroung him, and hopefully mess with a few on the way there. If you can learn it, you can break it :).

This blog in particular was created for writeups of... well, anything security-related I might do. This includes things like Hack The Box, TryHackMe, any CTFs I participate in, etc.
