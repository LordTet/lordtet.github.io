Hey there! I'm Jake. I work in cybersecurity, and am learning what I can about the systems around me. Learning can be done building solutions up, but for me is best done breaking solutions down.

Some quick about-me's:

* I'm a graduate of Rochester Institute of Technology.
    * I hold a Bachelors degree in Cybersecurity.
* I'm from New Jersey. The Tri-State area has my heart.
* My life largely runs on Unix machines. In many ways, the control I maintain over my technologies directly results in my efficiency.
* I discovered Cybersecurity as a field of interest out of an interest in assembly programming. This led directly to reverse enginering from reading disassembled binaries. Ultimately this became my favorite part about the field.
* My weapon of choice for scriping is Python. Most things I enjoy doing can be done in Python and C in some way.
* Besides a security analyst and engineer, I'm also a competitor. My competitive drive has led directly to the person I am today.
	* I have been competing in Super Smash Bros. Melee tournaments for over a decade.
